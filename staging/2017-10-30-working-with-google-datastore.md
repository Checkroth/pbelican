Summary: Notes from working with google datastore

I recently worked on a project in Google Cloud Platform using the following:

- Python Standard Environment
- Google Cloud Datastore

This is not a review of GCP or any of its tools, but here a few a thoughts on the experience:

- Standard Environment is unnecessarily constricting
- Running local environments is a hassle
- Documentation falls short in a lot of areas, particularly in technical details
- I really wouldn't recommend this environment unless it is for some reason mandatory (like it was for me)
