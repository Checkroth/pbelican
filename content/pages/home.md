Title: About Me

[Blog Home](/blog_index.html)

I graduated from Drexel University with a BS in Software Engineering in 2015, and have since then lived in Japan. I enjoy working with functional programming, and currently work remotely with Python/Django at [beproud.jp](https://www.beproud.jp).

I am a happy father of a two-year-old and live in Japan's Akita Prefecture.

Links to my resume, social media, and contact information are available in the side (or top) bar.

I intend to fill this blog with notes about things I learn while working, and probably some notes on food. Cooking western recipes in Japan is rather difficult, so many common recipes require quite a bit of ingredient replacemnet to be viable.

# About this Site

This site is statically generated with [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/). I previously had a generated static website made with scala and compiled with ammonite found [here](https://github.com/Checkroth/scalablog), but it was too much trouble to maintain and improve to be worth it.

The theme is [Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex) with [a few minor modifications](https://github.com/Checkroth/pbelican/blob/master/content/extra/custom.css) (colorscheme and minor layout changes).

It is hosted on GH Pages and mixes in Google Analytics, Adsense, and Disqus.
