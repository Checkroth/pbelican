[Blog Home](/blog_index.html)

I graduated from Drexel University with a BS in Software Engineering in 2015, and have since then lived in Japan. I enjoy working with functional programming, and currently work remotely for [joyz](https://www.joyz.co.jp).

I am a happy father of a two-year-old and live in Japan's Akita Prefecture.

Links to my resume, social media, and contact information are available in the side (or top) bar.
